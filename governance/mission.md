# Mission Statement

The Saskatoon Art Guide is a collaborative, living catalog of public art and murals in Saskatoon and, eventually, across Saskatchewan.

## Purpose

This project exists to:

- Document public artworks with accuracy and care
- Attribute creative work to the artists who made it
- Preserve records of murals and installations that may be temporary
- Provide a shared resource for residents, visitors, and researchers
- Track emerging practices including XR and WebAR-based public art

## What This Is Not

This is not a portfolio. It is not owned or branded by any single person. It is infrastructure built to serve the artistic community and the public.

## Governance

Josh Jacobson serves as a steward and curator of this catalog. He is one contributor among many, responsible for maintaining the structure, ensuring attribution accuracy, and accepting community submissions.

The guide prioritizes:

- **Artist-first attribution** — Artists are always credited by name.
- **Neutral documentation** — No rankings, commentary, or subjective assessments.
- **Community collaboration** — Submissions and corrections are welcome.
- **Long-term preservation** — Records are maintained even after artworks are removed or altered.

This catalog is a tool, not a brand. Its value lies in its accuracy, accessibility, and respect for the people who create public art.

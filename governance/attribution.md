# Attribution Policy

Attribution is the foundation of this catalog. All artworks must be credited to their creators accurately and prominently.

## Principles

1. **Artist names are always primary.**
   The artist who created the work is listed first and prominently in all records.

2. **No implied authorship by the guide.**
   The Saskatoon Art Guide does not claim ownership, creative credit, or authorship over documented artworks.

3. **Josh Jacobson is listed as artist only on works he authored.**
   When Josh Jacobson created the artwork, he is credited as the artist. When he documented or submitted information about someone else's work, he is listed as a contributor or source, not as the artist.

4. **Collaborative works are attributed to all contributors.**
   If a mural or installation involved multiple artists, all are credited by name.

5. **Corrections are prioritized.**
   If an attribution error is identified, it is corrected immediately.

## Metadata Requirements

Every artwork entry must include:

- **artist**: The name(s) of the person or people who created the work
- **source**: How the information was obtained (artist submission, public record, community contribution, etc.)
- **artist_contact**: A link to the artist's website or portfolio, if available

## Prohibited Practices

- Listing Josh Jacobson (or any curator) as the artist on works they did not create
- Using the catalog as promotional material for any individual
- Removing or obscuring artist names in derived datasets or presentations
- Implying endorsement or ranking through selective inclusion

Attribution is non-negotiable. If correct attribution cannot be established, the work should not be included until it can be verified.

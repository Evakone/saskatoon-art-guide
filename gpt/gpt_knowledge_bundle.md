# Knowledge Bundle: Saskatoon Art Guide

This document provides background context for the Saskatoon Art Guide GPT assistant.

The Saskatoon Art Guide is a collaborative, living catalog of public art and murals in Saskatoon and Saskatchewan. It is not a portfolio. It is infrastructure built to serve the artistic community and the public.

- Maintaining the data structure and schema
- Reviewing submissions for attribution accuracy
- Accepting community contributions
- Ensuring governance policies are followed

He is listed as the artist ONLY on artworks he personally created.

## XR as a Tracked Practice

The guide tracks emerging practices including XR (extended reality) and WebAR-based public art. These digital and hybrid installations are documented alongside traditional murals and sculptures.

## Mural Map Reference

For visual exploration of Saskatoon's public art, users may reference interactive mural maps when available. The guide provides structured data that can power such tools.

## Commission Inquiries

When users ask about commissioning murals or public art:

- If the artist's contact info is available in the catalog, provide it
- For Josh Jacobson's work, reference https://www.jjacobsondesign.ca
- Do not position the guide itself as a commission broker
- Emphasize direct artist contact when possible

## Community Contributions

The catalog welcomes submissions from:

- Artists documenting their own work
- Community members who observe public art
- Researchers with historical records
- Organizations that commissioned artworks

All submissions are reviewed for accuracy and adherence to the attribution policy.

## Attribution Priority

In all contexts:

1. Artist names come first
2. The guide does not claim creative credit
3. Josh Jacobson is curator, not default author
4. Corrections to attribution are prioritized immediately

## Scope and Coverage

The catalog is:

- Not comprehensive (yet)
- Growing through community collaboration
- Focused on accuracy over completeness
- Neutral and non-editorial

It tracks works that are active, removed, or altered, preserving historical records even after physical artworks are gone.
